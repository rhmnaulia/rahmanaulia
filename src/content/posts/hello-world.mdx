I decided to start this personal blog because I felt like something was missing from my life as a software engineer without having my own digital space, haha. My previous blog was just for show and never really got the attention it deserved. This time, I want to make it more real and regularly share things like writings, bits of code, everyday discoveries (Today I Learned), and basically anything I feel like posting.

When thinking about how the blog should look, I went for a simple design. My old blog was too busy with fancy stuff to look cool. Now, I'm going for a more grown-up and focused look, keeping it simple and functional without too much decoration.

After figuring out the design, I picked the techie tools I'll use. So, I went with Next.js + Tailwind + Shadcn UI + Vercel. It's not just what I'm used to; it also helps speed up the whole creating process. I thought about using Astro, but I stuck with Next.js because I believe it can do some pretty cool stuff. Next on the list is connecting to a database, maybe TursoDB? Right now, all the content is kept in my local storage.

And here's a little secret: this blog will gradually receive new features if I'm not lazy (Mood Driven Development) ðŸ˜…. I'm excited to see how this space evolves. Thanks for being part of this journey, and let's keep sharing what we know! ðŸ™Œ
