Hey, I'm Aulia Rahman, just a regular guy navigating the world of software engineering from the bustling streets of Jakarta, Indonesia. Right now, I'm grinding away at [GovTech Procurement](https://www.linkedin.com/company/govtech-procurement), where the tech challenges keep me on my toes.

But life's not just about work, you know? It's about the people who make it all worthwhile. I love kickin' back with my girlfriends, hanging out with my buddies, and soaking up that family love—it's the real good stuff.

Now, when I'm not glued to my laptop, you might catch me hitting the court for a game of basketball. There's something about the squeak of sneakers on the hardwood that just gets me going. And yeah, I'm into lifting weights too—not just for the gains, but for the mental clarity it brings.

I'm all about growth, not just in my code but in life. The tech world moves fast, and I'm here for it. Always eager to learn something new, always evolving because, let's face it, that's where the good stuff happens.

Come along for the ride as I figure out this software engineering maze, finding joy in the little things, and keeping it real. Let's connect, share, and grow—because life's too short for anything else.
