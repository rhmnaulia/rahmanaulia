I've tried them all, really. Notion, with its endless customization, and Obsidian, with its web of connections, had me hooked for a while. But here's the thing: I got caught up. More in playing with settings than actually writing down what mattered. So, I made a switch, back to basics, to Apple Notes. And here's why it's been a game-changer for me, using something called the PARA method.

### The Trap of Complexity

In the beginning, the more features, the better. I could spend hours setting up my workspace in Notion or linking thoughts in Obsidian. But eventually, I noticed something off. I was doing a lot of setting up and not much actual note-taking. It felt like I was more into the idea of being productive than actually being it.

### Finding PARA

Then, I stumbled upon the PARA method. It's a system to organize your digital life into Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. Simple, right? That's what I thought too. And it led me to give Apple Notes a real shot.

### Why Apple Notes?

Apple Notes is straightforward. It's there on all my devices, syncing without a hitch. Using PARA, I set up:

- **Projects**: For things I'm working on now. Each project gets a note.
- **Areas**: For ongoing responsibilities like work or personal growth. They get their folders.
- **Resources**: For information I might need again. Stored in their folders, easy to find.
- **Archives**: For everything done or outdated. Out of sight but there if I need them.

### The Real Change

What changed? A lot, actually. With Apple Notes, I'm writing more and fiddling less. There's no temptation to tweak settings because, well, there aren't many to tweak. And that's been great. My notes are organized, and I spend my time on what matters: the content.

### Keeping It Real

If you're like me, constantly tweaking and tuning your note-taking app, maybe it's time to consider if it's helping. I found that simplicity in Apple Notes, backed by a straightforward method like PARA, made me more productive. Not because it's the most powerful tool out there, but because it helps me focus on what I actually need to do: take notes, keep them organized, and get on with my day.
